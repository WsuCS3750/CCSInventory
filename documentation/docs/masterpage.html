<h1>Masterpage Inheritance</h1>

<p>Masterpages provide an "inheritance template" for pages that inherit from it.
    They are used in this project to provide graphical unity and user authentication
    across the application.
</p>

<h2>Masterpages</h2>

<h3>global.master</h3>

<p>The masterpage global.master provides a "user authentiaction umbrella" for the entire project,
    as well as session time-out managment. It does not provide any HTML structure, 
    but does include the background CCS watermark image.
</p>

<h3>Mobile.master</h3>

<p>All tablet pages inherit from Mobile.master. It provides the flexible width container, top menu, and other styles
    inherited by all tablet pages. Additionally, many desktop pages inherit from mobile.master styles.
</p>

<h3>Desktop.master</h3>

<p>Desktop designed pages (reports, user admin, etc) inherit from Desktop.master, which provides a style
    more appropriate for desktop width functions.
