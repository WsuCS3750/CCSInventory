<h1>Database Access</h1>

<h2>LINQ</h2>

<p>Database access is abstracted to LINQ data objects which are mapped to the SQL Server database tables.</p>

<h2>Sample Usage</h2>

<p>The following code sample gets a count of containers with a given bin number</p>

<pre>
using (CCSEntities db = new CCSEntities())
{
    int number = 1234;

    int count = (from c in db.Containers
                    where c.BinNumber == BinNumberCandidate
                    select c).Count();
}
</pre>

<p>The following code sample generates a list of containers suitable for a datatable or gridview</p>

<pre>
using (CCSEntities db = new CCSEntities())
{
    List<Container> lstContainers = (from c in db.Containers where c.Weight !=0 select c).ToList();
}
</pre>
