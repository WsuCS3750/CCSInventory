<h1>Audit</h1>

<p>
    The audit functionality, located in the audit folder, provides the ability quickly as easily inspect each
    container in the warehouse and either verify or correct their contents.
</p>

<h2>Audit Pages</h2>

<h3>default.aspx</h3>

<p>
    This page is used to show the user all audits that have been performed. They can click the accompanying
    "adjustments" button to view any corrections that were made during the audit. Using the "Perform Audit"
    button launches an audit session.
</p>

<h3>view.aspx</h3>

<p>
    This page displays the adjustments made during the audit process.
</p>

<h3>perform.aspx</h3>

<p>
    This page uses two GridViews. The first displays all containers that haven't yet been either verified or
    corrected. The second gridview shows all adjustments that were made to containers during the audit.
    The user can either select the "Verify" button next to a container or enter the container's
    Container Number to be brought the the verify.aspx page.
</p>

<h3>verify.aspx</h3>

<p>
    This page displays the information about the container. If the information is changed, then the "Verify"
    button turns into a "Save" button, meaning that the container's contents are incorrect and need to be
    adjusted.
