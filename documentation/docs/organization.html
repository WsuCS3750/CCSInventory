<h1>Project organization</h1>

<p>This project uses a modified "RESTful" url structure -- meaning: each entity has a unique url that it can
    be accessed from, with verb sub-urls. Each data object is represented by a directory in the project.
</p>

<p>For Example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>domain.com</li>
    <li>domain.com/container</li>
    <li>domain.com/container/add.aspx</li>
    <li>domain.com/container/print.aspx</li>
</ul>
