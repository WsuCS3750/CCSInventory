<h1>Error Logging</h1>

<p>Errors are caught by surrounding <pre>try{} catch{}</pre> blocks, and logged. 
    The user is then directed to errorpages/error.aspx
</p>
<p>Special consideration must be give when redirecting users via <pre>Response.Redirect()</pre>
    because that method works by generating a redirection exception which is inadvertantly 
    caught by error logging.
</p>
<p>The error log can be viewd at log/view-errorlog.aspx</p>
<h2>Sample Usage</h2>
<pre>
try
{
    // DO WORK
    Response.Redirect('new-page.aspx');
}
catch (System.Threading.ThreadAbortException) { }
catch (Exception ex)
{
    LogError.logError(ex);
    Response.Redirect("../errorpages/error.aspx");
}
</pre>
